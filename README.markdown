Rakefile for Kits 
=================
Rakefile for existing projects that which need a little massaging to turn into a kit.

*[Kit](https://github.com/nkpart/kit) is a dependency management tool for Obj-C/Xcode projects*

Features include
----------------
* **kit** - Find all source files and add them to the src folder where kit can package them up
* **kitspec** - create a kitspec named after the current working directory
* **bump** - Increment the least significant version numerer
* **find\_dups_** - Look for duplicate filenames as these will not work as a kit package
* **publish** - Local publish with dependencies of kitspec and kit
